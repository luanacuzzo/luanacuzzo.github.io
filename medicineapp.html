                    <h6>DISCOVERY</h6>
                    <h3>The Problem</h3>
                    <p>Don't you agree that it is just crazy that people go to the hospital to get help on a disease or
                        condition, but they fear they might get sicker? Doctor's offices are indeed vectors of
                        illnessess. This is just one of the reasons why there should be a change in the paradigm of
                        care. The benefits of Telehealth, which is health services delivered eletronically and at
                        distance, go from better patient engagement and satisfaction to cost reduction for both
                        hospitals and patients.</p>
                        <p>  With that in mind, let's dive into an experiment to find out what the ideal digital platform
                            would be like in terms of usability, disaribility, and accessibility.</p>

                    <p>From the patient perspective, because that's the audience we want to better
                        serve. There will be a more notable impact if the healthcare system is improved for the
                        patients.
                    </p>
                    <h4>When:</h4>
                    <p>The interaction with the
                        system will probably start with users feeling
                        sick and trying to get an appointment or get diagnosed from where they are.</p>
                    <h4>Where:</h4>    
                    <p>Patients could be
                        anywhere. At home,
                        school, work, traveling, etc.</p>
                    <h4>Feelings:</h4>      
                    <p>Users probably feel anxious and uncertain.</p>
                    <p>Most popular reasons for patients to visit a clinic: prescription renewal,
                        general checkup, blood pressure disorder, sick note for employer, back-pain, mental health,
                        diabetes, vaccination, etc.</p>

                        forgive airlines that hide important information such as
                        stopovers during the booking process. Finding out about stopovers only at the checkout
                        stage, will really make users abandon the process. As a result of their frustration, users
                        won't feel inclined to ever try that same airline again.</p>
                    <p class="subheadlines">#2 Personalization saves scrolling time</p>
                    <p class="bodytext">Why give users a thousand options they don't need, when we can give them
                        control of their preferences right form the start? Even though personalization adds up some
                        time to the booking process, it saves scrolling time. It's more frustrating to go through a
                        thousand of different flight options then to answer a couple of questions that are pertnent
                        to users'real needs.</p>
                    <p class="subheadlines">#3 Just the right number of filters give users control</p>
                    <p class="bodytext">Users should be given a positive feeling of choice and control when having
                        to decide among so many different options, and that should be done in the beggning of the
                        process. Users need to understand what their options are and why they have these options.</p>
                    <p class="subheadlines">#4 Innovation Require Small Steps</p>
                    <p class="bodytext">Taking into account that, even with lots of bumps, most users are able to
                        accomplish the online booking task, we can consider the Airline UX relatively satisfactory.
                        However, there is still a lot of room for improvement and innovation. Obviously, it can't
                        be done overnight, because user's mental models are not ready for sudden big changes. The
                        least we can do though to bring a more human-like feel to Airlines
                        apps is to change language with one that is more conversational. Then, we should show more
                        interest in what it is that users are actually looking for. Forcing them to choose a
                        fare-type that the Airline wants hasn't worked.
                    </p>
                    <p class="bodytext">Imagining <span class="highlight">the future of Airline Websites</span>, I can
                        picture a platform that is responsive, as they shoulbe be reliabe and consistent
                        regardless of what device users want to book their flights from. I picture a platform
                        that is smart as to know where users are booking a flight from, and what their preferences
                        are based on history.</p>
                    <p class="bodytext">
                        Travelers are become more modern and Airline apps should follow along.
