                    <h6>OVERVIEW</h6>
                    <p>Exploring better ways to book a flight online has come a long way, yet people
                        still struggle in the process. Motivated by the potential
                        to create a friction-free booking process, I analyzed what giant competitors in this industry
                        are doing to offer a better experience. Then, I suggested a solution to simplify
                        the
                        way
                        we
                        book flights online.</p>

                    <p>
                        Simplifying that process means primarily reducing user bugs and frictions. However,
                        focusing
                        only
                        on
                        taking out the pain doesn't seem enough to me. What if we could bring more pleasure and
                        <strong>innovation</strong>
                        into the experience? Let's start with simple questions. Why do people drop along the
                        way?
                        How
                        can
                        we speed up the process? How can we make it a more human-like experience?

                    <h3>The Problem</h3>
                    <h5>Why are airlines suffering with low conversion rates on their mobile apps?
                    </h5>
                    <p>It all starts with users looking forward to going on holiday in a couple of
                        weeks. They access
                        their favorite airline apps to research prices and availability, which was supposed to be a
                        simple
                        step-by-step task. As it turns out, users start coming across
                        inconsistencies and misleading pieces of information. They get more and more confused with
                        different fare
                        types. And finally, users don't feel
                        compelled to proceed to checkout.They are much better off abandoning the process right there.

                    <h3>Competitive Benchmarking and Heuristic Evaluation</h3>
                    <p>I carried out UX audit with some of the leading airline companies in North
                        America and Europe to learn what their mobile apps are doing well and what they need to work on.
                        Here's a breakdown of my findings:</p>

            </div>

                Even though users are able to accomplish their tasks, none of these companies offer a friction-free
                experience.

                    <h3>Design Decisions and Rationale</h3>
                    <h5>Mobile First Approach</h5>
                    <p>It's time we enabled users with the flexibility and security to book a
                        flight
                        from anywhere with a simple reach into their pockets.</p>
                    <h5>Filters</h5>
                    <p>To replace long texts and give users control from the start.</p>
                    <h5>Let's dismistify the fair-type confusion</h5>
                    <p>Airlines tend to force 'the best' or 'recommended' fare to users without
                        taking
                        into account what their real needs are.</p>
                    <p>Let's give users an opportunity to upgrade their flight experience with the
                        items they choose only.
                        And let's allow them to do that before and after booking the flight!</p>
                    <h5>No more fooling users around with hidden stopovers!</h5>
                    <p>Misleading information was identified to be one of the main reasons why
                        users
                        abandon the booking process when proceeding to checkout.</p>
                    <p>Let's make things clear for uses right from the start. If we don't tell
                        users
                        about stopovers at this stage, they will forget all about it later in the process.</p>
                    <p>Using a conversational language not only will keep users engaged through the
                        process but will help them make decisions, it will also eliminate confusion and raise their
                        trust in the app.</p>

                    <h3>Learnings</h3>
                    <h5>#1 Reliability is key for a solid Airline UX</h5>
                    <p>It's very frustrating for users to go through a whole booking process, only
                        to find out at the end that they are paying for something they didn't ask for. Users won't
                        forgive airlines that hide important information such as
                        stopovers during the booking process. Finding out about stopovers only at the checkout
                        stage, will really make users abandon the process. As a result of their frustration, users
                        won't feel inclined to ever try that same airline again.</h5>
                    <h5>#2 Personalization saves scrolling time</h5>
                    <p>Why give users a thousand options they don't need, when we can give them
                        control of their preferences right form the start? Even though personalization adds up some
                        time to the booking process, it saves scrolling time. It's more frustrating to go through a
                        thousand of different flight options then to answer a couple of questions that are pertnent
                        to users'real needs.</p>
                    <h5>#3 Just the right number of filters give users control</h5>
                    <p>Users should be given a positive feeling of choice and control when having
                        to decide among so many different options, and that should be done in the beggning of the
                        process. Users need to understand what their options are and why they have these options.</p>
                    <h5>#4 Innovation Require Small Steps</h5>
                    <p>Taking into account that, even with lots of bumps, most users are able to
                        accomplish the online booking task, we can consider the Airline UX relatively satisfactory.
                        However, there is still a lot of room for improvement and innovation. Obviously, it can't
                        be done overnight, because user's mental models are not ready for sudden big changes. The
                        least we can do though to bring a more human-like feel to Airlines
                        apps is to change language with one that is more conversational. Then, we should show more
                        interest in what it is that users are actually looking for. Forcing them to choose a
                        fare-type that the Airline wants hasn't worked.
                    </p>
                    <p>Imagining <span class="highlight">the future of Airline Websites</span>, I can
                        picture a platform that is responsive, as they shoulbe be reliabe and consistent
                        regardless of what device users want to book their flights from. I picture a platform
                        that is smart as to know where users are booking a flight from, and what their preferences
                        are based on history.</p>
                    <p>
                        Travelers are become more modern and Airline apps should follow along.
